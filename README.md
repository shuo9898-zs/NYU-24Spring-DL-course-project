Reducing car emission can be eco-friendly to our earth and environment.

We found that increasing or decreasing speed of vehicle frequently would release more emissions than smooth control.

To reduce the emission, we create a Connected-autonomous driving system based on Multi-agent Q-learning. The envirnoment we use is SUMO. All vehicle information and vehicle control are applied through SUMO API
